- #### Metadata
> - A Machine Consumable & Automation Friendly dataset is published & kept [`UP To Date`](https://github.com/pkgforge/pkgcache/actions/workflows/healthchecks_housekeeping.yaml)
> - It's available as `JSON`, `TOML` & `YAML`
> > - [aarch64-Linux](https://github.com/pkgforge/pkgcache/blob/main/aarch64-Linux/METADATA.urls)
> > - [x86_64-Linux](https://github.com/pkgforge/pkgcache/blob/main/x86_64-Linux/METADATA.urls)
> - Example:
> > ```bash
> > !#${ARCH} is just $(uname -m), i.e aarch64 or x86_64
> > "https://bin.pkgforge.dev/${ARCH}/METADATA.AIO.json"
> > "https://bin.pkgforge.dev/aarch64/METADATA.AIO.json"
> > "https://bin.pkgforge.dev/x86_64/METADATA.AIO.json"
> > ```
> > ```json
> > //The Structure is like:
> >  {
> >    "base": [
> >       {
> >          ${Binaries from bin.pkgforge.dev/${ARCH}/**/Baseutils/**}
> >       }
> >    ],
> >    "bin" : [
> >       {
> >          ${Binaries are from core bin.pkgforge.dev/$ARCH}/**}
> >       }
> >    ],
> >    "pkg" : [
> >       {
> >          ${Binaries, or rather pkgs are from pkgforge/pkgcache}
> >       }
> >    ]
> > ```

- #### Using [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/) to Parse [METADATA.json](https://pkg.pkgforge.dev/METADATA.json)
> - This is a basic example demonstrating how easy it is to work with the Metadata
> ```bash
> #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
> # Host Triplet
> echo "$(uname -m)" #either x86_64 or aarch64
> #---------------------#
> # Append `| jq -r '.$TYPE[].$PROPERTY'` to filter them, for example:
> !# Simple example to: list all Pkgs in .pkg
> curl -qfsSL "https://bin.pkgforge.dev/$(uname -m)/METADATA.AIO.json" | jq -r '.pkg[] | .pkg'
>
> !#To pretty print anything that matches qbittorrent from .pkg
> curl -qfsSL "https://bin.pkgforge.dev/$(uname -m)/METADATA.AIO.json" | jq -r '.pkg[] | select(.pkg | test("qbittorrent"; "i")) | "---------------------------\n" + (. | to_entries | map("\(.key): \(.value)") | join("\n"))'
> ```

- #### URL Redirects
> - If you don't like the long urls in the [Metadata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pkgforge/pkgcache/resolve/main/METADATA.json), or consider them ugly.
> - I have set `URL` Redirects, so as long as your client follows a `301`, you can basically use any of these to reach to any `$ARCH/$HOST`
> - The ones in the Left will Redirect you to Correct `Location/Link` (Ones in the Right)
> > Examples:
> > ```bash
> > !# curl needs the `-L, --location` flag to Follow redirects
> > !# wget works without any flags
> >
> > !# Example
> > curl -qfsSLO "https://pkg.pkgforge.dev/$(uname -m)/$PKG_OR_PATH_TO_PKG"
> >
> > ```
